# Imperial College London Mathematics Year 2 Notes

My notes from year 2 of Mathematics at Imperial College.
I am a Joint Mathematics and Computing student, so I don't take all the modules that pure maths students do.

Each document in this repository follows the structure of the corresponding official notes, skipping proofs and examples but including all definitions, theorems etc.
Anything that is numbered in the official notes should have the same number here.
In many places I have changed notation or structure slightly for clarity and/or brevity.
Any significant departure from the official course content is pointed out within the document.

I cannot guarantee that the information provided here is accurate.
If something seems off, please do check the official notes as well.
In the event that you do notice a mistake, don't hesitate to message me or create an issue or a pull request.
